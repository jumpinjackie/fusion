Jx is an open source library available from http://code.google.com/p/jxlib/.  A copy of a specific version of Jx is included with Fusion.  The current version is:

Jx 2.0 alpha

Fusion trunk (after the 1.1 version) will not work with earlier versions of Jx than 2.0, and Fusion 1.1 (and earlier) will not work with the 2.0 versions of Jx.
